install all libraries by 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in cmd of the project's evnt
first run 'runActiveMQ.py'
parallelly run 'FlaskPage.py'

1. we fetched the links using feedparser lib 
2.we made connection with activemq using stomp.py
3. now we will create a db1 which will store all the fetched links of step1
4. also push all the links to activemq 
note: we are creating db1 to avoid the duplication of links as we cannot check that in queue
5.then we have to create a listener which will collect one link at a time from activemq (as queue uses push mechanism) and send to newspaper lib python file
6. now make a python file using newspaper library which will fetch title,published date, article and author.(remember it will fetch for one link at a time only)
7. now make db2 which will store all the fetched content from the step6

so overall we have 2 applications :
	 1: which fetches links from the newsurls using feedparser library  
	 2: the newspaper library file which fetches the content from those links
